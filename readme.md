# Rust learning

That's my private Rust learning projects.

## Projects

1. Sample001 - Printing with `println!` macro and formatting
2. Sample002 - Recursive fibonacci with `if` and `match`
3. Sample003 - Calling functions with passing ownership, by `ref` and `mut ref`
4. Sample004 - Binding scopes, rebinding
5. Sample005 - Return by `ref` and new object
6. Sample006 - Structures and tuples
7. Sample007 - Enum with function that do `match`, enum with tuple
8. Sample008 - Function with `if` and `match`, and `break` with value
9. Sample009 - Function with binding lifetime
10. Sample010 - Passing binding ownership to objects
11. Sample011 - Passing binding ownership to simple types
12. Sample012 - Lifetime `static` vs real `static`
13. Sample013 - Struct with function implementations 
14. Sample014 - Enum with `match`
15. Sample015 - Struct with trait implementation using `ref` and `dyn ref`
16. Sample016 - Struct with overloaded trait implementations
17. Sample017 - Enum with generic
18. Sample018 - Constructor and destructor 
19. Sample019 - Function returns `Option`
20. Sample020 - Function returns `Result`
21. Sample021 - Loading URLs from file, call them in threads
22. Sample022 - Loading URLs from file, call them with `async/await`
23. Sample023 - Loading URLs from file, call then with `async/await` using `tokio`
24. Sample024 - Tuples with Debug and Display trait
25. Sample025 - Arrays and slices
26. Sample026 - Enum with tuple and c-like structure, with `type` alias and `impl` function
